Welcome to ViralSharer, first child node of ViralShellter.

Before going forward with using this software, THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED PUBLICALLY, or atleast not till further updates. Any harm caused due to it being implemented publically will not be associated with the developer of ViralShellter or any of its nodes, in this case, ViralSharer.

ViralSharer V0.1.0 is meant to be a very basic release supporting file transfers of ALL TYPES over http. Over the next few weeks, we will be pushing patches and updates, but if all you want is a quick way to transfer some files and dont feel particularly interested in firing up the 'Ol FTP or going ahead and firing up SimpleHTTPServer, then ViralSharer is your friend.

ViralSharer is a NodeJS application that is meant to transfer files across devices. As of V0.1.0, there is no impressive GUI, as the primary focus was to build a solution to move around files from one place to another within the same network. Its intuitive to use, and expect some massive changes soon [ not only on ViralSharer ;) ].

Any, and all files uploaded will be listed under the directory Uploads/{MailUser.Service} path. All uploaded files can also be seen by navigating to /access page and entering the mail you uploaded the files under. Vulnerabilities may be found, primarily LFI and/or accessing other files within the same application under different users. We will be isolating them in the future releases. So, just hold up before firing it up on your public server :)

For now,
Enjoy the first release of many under The Most Busted Repo On Github aka TMBROG

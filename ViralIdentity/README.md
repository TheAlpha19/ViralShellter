ViralIdentity, the second node of ViralShellter is an identity generator that gives out generated names and possible mail id's matching the name.

To use the tool, simply build it using g++ main.cpp -o bin/Debug/ViralIdentity.exe, or go to the bin/ folder and grab the binary and fire it up. No releases will be officially released at this time, and new features will be added as time goes on.

To add new names or a set of names, edit Lists/first-names.txt and/or middle-names.txt [https://github.com/dominictarr/random-name].

This is NOT meant for PUBLIC USE. Any harm caused due to it being implemented publically will not be associated with the developer of ViralShellter or any of its nodes, in this case, ViralIdentity.

For now,
enjoy using ViralIdentity, under ViralShellter.
